# Customer Dashboard Project

🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: Customer Dashboard completed using Tableau!** <br>

This project focused on providing actionable insights into customer data, trends, and behaviors, enabling better decision-making for marketing teams and management. Here's what I accomplished: <br>

✨ **KPI Overview**: Summarized total number of customers, total sales per customer, and total number of orders for the current and previous year. <br>
🔢 **Customer Trends**: Analyzed monthly data for key performance indicators, highlighting months with the highest and lowest sales using intuitive visual indicators. <br>
📊 **Customer Distribution by Number of Orders**: Visualized the distribution of customers based on the number of orders to uncover insights into behavior, loyalty, and engagement. <br>
📊 **Top 10 Customers by Profit**: Identified and presented the top 10 customers who contributed the highest profits, along with detailed information like rank, number of orders, sales, profit, and last order date. <br>

This experience enhanced my data visualization and storytelling skills, helping me turn complex datasets into meaningful business insights. Leveraging Tableau, I was able to create a user-friendly dashboard tailored to understanding customer segments and improving satisfaction. <br>

🙏 **Gratitude** <br>
Grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and apply my skills to deliver impactful results. Looking forward to more exciting challenges ahead! <br>
